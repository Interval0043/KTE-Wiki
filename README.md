This being a private repository, you're only here if I gave you access. But here's all of the backend stuff, just so you know what's going on.

I trust that you will make good decisions in your commits. I will be checking them, and so will others. You shouldn't be doing one file at a time, you should be doing large chunks and committing them all at once, for better contribution history, unless it's small issues.
